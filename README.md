## Reason for this project
The reason I started with this project is that I always wondered if there could be a way to stay up to date on Azure DevOps extensions on the Marketplace: there are many extensions available in it and if you don’t check the marketplace regularly, you can easily miss some gems. Of course, when you encounter a specific problem, you will probably find the extensions when you need them, but I thought this was a fun thing to do.

Searching around did seemed to prove there isn’t a good way to stay up to date on the extensions: there is no RSS feed, Twitter bot, or any other option than to regularly check the “Most recent” feed. Since I still am a developer, I thought I could probably make something myself and that this should be a fun thing to do that should not cost to much time to make!
